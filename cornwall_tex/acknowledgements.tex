\paragraph{Over the past two years,} volunteers on the Cornwall \gls{cac} have 
worked to develop the Cornwall \gls{nri}. The Cornwall NRI uses maps and 
narrative to document the natural and cultural resources found in both the Town 
of Cornwall and Village of Cornwall-on-Hudson.
\par
The Cornwall NRI’s development has been a labor of love that the Cornwall CAC 
could not have embarked upon without the support of Town Supervisor Richard 
Randazzo, Village Mayor Brendan Coyne, and the respective Boards. With Board 
approval, the Cornwall CAC applied for a technical assistance opportunity from 
the NYS Department of Environmental Conservation’s \gls{hrep} and Cornell 
University for the development of an intermunicipal NRI. The assistance 
supported our work through the provision of data and content expertise from 
HREP’s Laura Heady and funded Orange County Water Authority’s Kelly Morris and 
Orange County Planning Department's Benjamin Freiman, whose GIS mapping skills 
were invaluable to the project. Matt Decker of Orange County Land Trust also 
supported this effort with additional data as well as content and GIS mapping 
expertise.
\par
Because natural resources do not follow jurisdictional boundaries, HREP 
encourages municipalities to partner in the development of NRIs. The Town and 
Village had the pleasure of partnering with the Town of Blooming Grove 
Conservancy Advisory Commission (Blooming Grove CAC), working closely with its 
volunteers on map reviews, writing, and final product development.
\par
The Cornwall CAC would also like to acknowledge the time and commitment of 
various community residents, local leaders, and regional experts who served as 
reviewers for the Cornwall NRI. We could not be confident in the quality of 
the Cornwall NRI without their participation.
\par
Many hands make light work. We thank our numerous partners for their support 
throughout this process. The Cornwall CAC plans to honor their contributions 
in the coming years by sharing the learnings found within the Cornwall Natural 
Resources Inventory with the community through the Cornwall CAC’s outreach and 
education efforts. We hope you will find the maps and narrative informative 
and useful.
